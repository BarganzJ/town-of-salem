Validator
----------------------

Note: The Validator runs fully each time, even if an infraction is raised. This is to collect all of them.

The Validator calls all the sub Validators, collects infractions, and a bit of data on the Mafia.

Upon completion, it returns the infractions. If there are any, all data is considered corrupt. If none, data is good to go.

----------------------
Mafia Validator
----------------------

Scan the role list and document the following things:
    - Number of Mafia in the role list
    - Number of Mafia Killing(category) in the role list
    - Number of roles belonging to Mafia Killing in the role list

Exceeding five mafia is not allowed and is an automatic infraction.

If the sum of the second and third number collected is 0 while there is mafia in the list, and there is no Random Mafia in the list, we raise an infraction.
If there does happen to be a Random Mafia in the list, then we will return that data once we finish the scan.

If the sum of those two numbers exceed 2, an infraction is raised of too many killing roles.

----------------------
Faction Validator
----------------------

Scan the role list, document each unique faction that appears, as well as the frequency of the Any and Random Neutral categories.

If the amount of unique factions is greater than or equal to 2, the validation has passed, and we can quit with returning an empty list.

If the amount of unique factions is equal to 1, we look to see the number of Any's and Random Neutral's.
If their sum is equal to or more than 1, the validation passes. If it isn't, we do one more check to see if there is a Vigilante and a Witch in the list.
If there is, the validation passes. Failing that, however, means that we raise an infraction of too little factions.

If the amount of unique factions is zero, we check to see that the sum of the Any and Random Neutral numbers.
If it is greater than or equal to two, the validation passes the list. Otherwise, we raise an infraction.

Return the list of all the unique factions detected.

----------------------
Unique Validator
----------------------

Scans the list, and for each role, checks if they are Unique and appear multiple times. If yes, note that role down.

In the end, return the list, as well as raise an infraction if the list of the duplicates has any elements in it.

----------------------
Vampire Validator
----------------------

Checks the size limit of the vampires(5), and raises an infraction if it is exceeded.

Also raises an infraction if there is a Vampire Hunter present without any Vampires.
