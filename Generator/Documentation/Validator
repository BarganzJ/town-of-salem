Validator
----------------------

Note: The Validator runs fully each time, even if an infraction is raised. This is to collect all of them.

The Validator calls all the sub Validators, collects infractions, and a bit of data on the Mafia.

Upon completion, it returns the infractions. If there are any, all data is considered corrupt. If none, data is good to go.

Mafia Validator
----------------------

Scan the role list and document the following things:
    - Number of Mafia in the role list
    - Number of Mafia Killing(category) in the role list
    - Number of roles belonging to Mafia Killing in the role list

Exceeding five mafia is not allowed and is an automatic infraction.

If the sum of the second and third number collected is 0 while there is mafia in the list, and there is no Random Mafia in the list, we raise an infraction.
If there does happen to be a Random Mafia in the list, then we will return that data once we finish the scan.

If the sum of those two numbers exceed 2, an infraction is raised of too many killing roles.
