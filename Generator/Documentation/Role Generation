Incomplete Role List - A role list with any number of elements in the list being a category of roles, and the role list potentially violating game rules(ex: it has more than five mafia roles).

Complete Role List - A role list with every single element in the list being a specific role, and it abiding by game rules.

1. Requirements

    After the user passes in their incomplete role list, and the validator checks to make sure that it could be made into a complete role list, it is now time to generate such a list. When generating the complete role list however, not only does the generation have to generate the roles fairly, but it has to abide by the game rules.
