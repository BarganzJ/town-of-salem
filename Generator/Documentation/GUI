Logic for State 1
-----------------

User selects a category from top-left
User sees varying roles for the appropriate category bottom-right
User selects a role from the bottom-right display
Role appears in the appropriate stack location top-middle display
User continues selecting roles/categories for a maximum of 15 roles selected
User can at any time click the button at the bottom-middle, removing the top role from the top-middle display
User clicks on the generate button at bottom-right:
    - If less than 6, update the middle-right display with that violation
    - Run the validation suite with role list in the top-middle display
    - Validation fails: display all violations on the middle-right display
    - Validation passes: transition to state 2

-----------------
Logic for State 2
-----------------

Grab the role list from State 1 and save it
Run generation with the role list
Display the results within the left panel
User clicks top-right button(regenerate) - Repeat previous two points
User clicks bottom-right button(return) - Transition to state 1
