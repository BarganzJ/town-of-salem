This file contains the role tiers.
Role tiers indicate in which order players actions should be processed.
Tiers are important because some roles influence the actions and results of other roles.
They also allow us to make important assumptions when we process the activity.
Roles on the same tier can be processed in any arbitrary order.
There are special cases which will be addressed as well.

Tier 1: Jailor
Tier 2: Veteran
Tier 3: Transporter
Tier 4: Witch
Tier 5: Consort, Escort
Tier 6: Consigliere, Framer, Blackmailer
Tier 7: Sheriff, Investigator
Tier 8: Doctor, Bodyguard, Survivor
Tier 9: Vampire Hunter, Vigilante, Mafia's killing role, Serial Killer, Arsonist, Vampire
Tier 10: Forger, Janitor, Disguisor
Tier 11: Spy, Lookout
Tier 12(no actions): Medium, Mayor, Retributionist, Jester, Executioner, Werewolf, Amnesiac

Special case 1: Vigilante and Disguisor will go to Tier 12 unless controlled by a witch,
where they will instead go to their listed tier location
