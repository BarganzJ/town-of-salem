Town of Salem is an online flash game in which up to 15 players can play. The game is one of the various spin-offs on the classic Mafia party game, in which you compete against other factions and attempt to secure victory. 

This program aims to emulate the game generating the initial "role list", and the subsequent activity that occurs on the first night of the game, from people investigating, to others attacking. 

Currently, the output is terminal based. In there, all 15 players will be displayed, along with what each one of them did, if they obtained any results from that night, and other players effects on them. The role list is currently fixed, and is taken from the ranked mode from the flash game.

Todo(in preferred order):
Make a batch file for easy external user execution
Generalize the role list generator
Generalize the role classes(currently they assume ranked format, remove that assumption)
Implement a GUI to allow the user to select their own role list and see the night one results
Refactor the activity processor so that a priority queue is used instead
Refactor the activity inner class and move the data into the abstract role class
